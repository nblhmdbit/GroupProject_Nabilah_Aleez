Programming Data Analytics Group Project 
Project Python (Jupyter Notebook) -IMDB Movie Data Analysis
Overview
The goal of this Python project is to gain knowledge about the entertainment industry by examining IMDB movie data. Important details such film names, genres, directors, actors, ratings, income, and more are included in the dataset. This project's main goal is to use Python data analysis tools to find patterns in movie trends, respond to relevant business issues, and assist in decision-making within the film industry.
Project Files Involved:
1.	Jupyter Notebook including all of the project's Python code and analysis is called IMDB Movie Analysis.ipynb.
2.	The dataset for study is IMDB-Movie-Data.csv, a CSV file containing IMDB movie data.
3.	Youtube Link for presentation Video
Objectives 
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use data visualisations and statistical summaries to investigate and comprehend the dataset's structure and properties.
2.	Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: To get the dataset ready for analysis, handle missing values, fix mistakes, and change variables.
3.	Trend Analysis: To comprehend their impact on the film industry, identify important trends in movie genres, income, ratings, and other important variables.
4.	Actors, directors, and films with the highest ratings: Examine the highest rated films, filmmakers, and performers according to box office earnings, user reviews, and general performance indicators.
5.	Conclusions and Suggestions: Condense the findings of the analysis and offer practical suggestions to the film industry's participants.
Libraries needed to have to complete the Python Project:
1.	Pandas: For analysing and manipulating data.
2.	Numpy: For mathematical computations and numerical operations.
3.	For making interactive, animated, and static visualisations, use matplotlib.
4.	Seaborn: For visualising statistical data, particularly complex information in a graphical format.
Conclusion
To obtain important insights about the film industry, this IMDB Movie Data Analysis project makes use of a variety of data analysis methodologies. We can discover new trends, comprehend audience preferences, and derive conclusions that assist studios, marketers, and filmmakers in making better decisions by examining historical film data. The results of this project provide a better understanding of how a film's success and audience reaction are influenced by elements such as genre, ratings, and income.
